      The Perspectives platform provides a medium to exercise data.
    </p>
    <p class="f5 lh-copy">
      A Perspective is a tailored data visualisation and exploration tool that provides a balanced understanding of a specific aspect of your city. By bringing together multiple related datasets and applying frameworks or models, each Perspective condenses complex inter-related measures into a form that can be readily understood and shared.
    </p>
    <p class="f5 lh-copy">
      The Perspectives platform provides insights across core strategy areas that can help to inform stakeholders of what the right questions are. BucketLabsâ€™ goal is not to simply provide tools for data, but to provide tools that can support the processes of strategic and operational planning.
