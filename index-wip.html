    <div class="fl w-100 w-60-l white f4 lh-copy fw3">
      <p>The population of our cities is rising so quickly that traditional city and social planning isn’t sufficiently predictive, responsive and cost-effective.</p>
      <p>Our cities inability to adapt and act, the resulting growing social inequality, strained services and infrastructure, and decline in our natural capital, are threatening our communities’ ability to thrive.  The stakes are becoming very high.</p>

    <div class="fl w-100 w-60-l white f4 lh-copy fw3">
      <p>We live in a golden age of technology: sophisticated sensor devices and enormous computing power are available inexpensively to even small organisations, and techniques like machine learning can now help humans draw helpful insights from data even in the midst of chaotic change.</p>
      <p>The emerging Smart Cities field promises to apply these new tools and technologies to help our communities address their key issues.  Success for cities will depend on how they apply these technologies and how they can evolve traditional operating models to leverage the insights they gain to make more informed and more timely decisions.</p>
      <p>Standing still amidst the wave of technology innovation is no longer an option.</p>

    <div class="fl w-100 w-60-l navy f4 lh-copy fw3">
      <p>For those who embrace change we see an exciting path ahead enabling cities, agencies and vendors to collaborate around data with less expense and risk. Partners will win by exchanging data and learnings easily, and by federating them with other organisations.</p>
      <p>This exchange between agencies within a city will enable elevated thinking and collective wisdom, and that same open sharing and communication between cities will let us all tackle our enormous challenges and opportunities together as a broader national community.</p>

    <div class="fl w-100 w-60-l white f4 lh-copy fw3">
      <p>When cities of all sizes can plan effectively and learn from each other, with the cost-effective involvement of commercial vendors, we will have enabled a Smart Nation: this is our mission.</p>
      <p>Our vision for our customers is that when the BucketLabs Platform is fully integrated into their operations, we will provide them a new “operating system” where decisions are always made with a complete understanding of the context around the decision.</p>
      <p>On this foundation, with an ecosystem of trusted technology partners, more open and transparent collaboration between public and private interests will lower the risk of applying new technology for cities purpose and usher in new ‘ways of working’ that are more flexible and adaptable to the current pace of innovation.</p>

    <div class="fl w-100 w-60-l navy f4 lh-copy fw3">
      <p>Data is the infrastructure of the future. In the same way that roads paved today’s economy, data will build the knowledge economy of tomorrow.  Though the amount of data being generated by the world is growing exponentially, and those who wish to capitalise on it must be ready with tools that can extract its value.  That’s where BucketLabs comes in.</p>
      <p>Working with leading practitioners in their respective fields, we’re developing a platform where decision making frameworks that identify and curate data into meaningful perspectives facilitate more informed and timely decision making against the most pressing challenges our cities face today.</p>
      <p>Our team have deep practical experience on a wide range of emerging smart cities technologies. Working with trusted partners we can fill in the gaps in your data by sourcing high-value relevant data from a range of technology providers, spanning Sensing, IoT, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.</p>
      <p>Our goal is to make this capability easily available and replicable to every city no matter how small or large.</p>
